# Hilo
Is luck on your side today? Prove it by playing Hilo! The rules are simple. Guess if the next card is lower or higher than the previous one. If you guess right, you win 100 points. Otherwise, you lose 75. As long as you have points, you can keep playing. If not, the game is over.

## Getting Started

project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
